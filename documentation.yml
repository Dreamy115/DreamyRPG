  Each item rarity is represented by a color; they go from worst to best like this:

  ðŸŸ¤ Poor
  
  âšª Common
  
  ðŸŸ¢ Uncommon
  
  ðŸ”µ Rare
  
  ðŸŸ£ Enhanced
  
  ðŸŸ¡ Legendary
  
  ðŸ”´ Prototype


  For RPing purposes, Poor items should be starter or junk, anything goes in the middle,
  and Prototype items should be fully unique or a set of unique items.

  I recommend Common items not have Modifier Modules,
  Uncommon ones having a 2 small ones chosen from 3,
  Rare having 3 moderate boosts chosen from 4-5,
  Enhanced having 3-4 strong ones chosen from 5-6,
  Legendary having 2-3 even stronger chosen from 5-6 and interesting passives.
  Prototype shouldn't have modifier modules and instead have more interesting passives.

  Remember, after all, the GM has all the creative freedom and these are only suggestions.
