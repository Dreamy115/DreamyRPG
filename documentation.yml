item_rarities: >
  Each item rarity is represented by a color; they go from worst to best like this:

  ðŸŸ¤ Poor
  
  âšª Common
  
  ðŸŸ¢ Uncommon
  
  ðŸ”µ Rare
  
  ðŸŸ£ Enhanced
  
  ðŸŸ¡ Legendary
  
  ðŸ”´ Prototype


  For RPing purposes, Poor items should be starter or junk, anything goes in the middle,
  and Prototype items should be fully unique or a set of unique items.

  I recommend Common items not have Modifier Modules,
  Uncommon ones having a 2 small ones chosen from 3,
  Rare having 3 moderate boosts chosen from 4-5,
  Enhanced having 3-4 strong ones chosen from 5-6,
  Legendary having 2-3 even stronger chosen from 5-6 and interesting passives.
  Prototype shouldn't have modifier modules and instead have more interesting passives.

  Remember, after all, the GM has all the creative freedom and these are only suggestions.
ability_roles: |
  **Duelist**
  Duelists excel in 1v1, but needs buffs and heals to be useful in a party battle. Typically high-damage low-health.

  **Motivator**
  Motivators help their teammates with buffs and heals without focusing too much on their own damage output.
  
  **Controller**
  Controllers hand out debuffs to the enemy team and excel in crowd control.

  **Tank**
  Tanks force enemies to target them first by protecting allies with abilities while leaving themselves exposed. 
protection_/_dodge: >
  **Armor|Dissipate** combine into **Protection**.
  Both work similarly, blocking **Physical** and **Energy** damage respectively. **True** damage can only be reduced with status effects.

  Final protection amount is calculated by the *victim*'s **Armor|Dissipate** decreased by *attacker*'s **Lethality|Passthrough** as a flat decrease.
  It cannot go lower than 0. If it does, round up to 0.

  Formula for damage multiplier is `DMG*(100/(100+PROT))`;
  where DMG is incoming damage and PROT is the final protection amount.


  **Parry|Deflect** combine into **Dodge**.
  It is the amount that decreases the *attacker*'s **Accuracy** depending if it's **Melee** or **Ranged** damage respectively. 

  The final amount is the percentage probability of the strike connecting.
